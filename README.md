# ðŸŽ¾ ATP 2024 Match Outcome Prediction with Random Forest

This project uses **ATP 2024 tennis match statistics** to predict the winner of a match using a **Random Forest Classifier**. The pipeline includes data cleaning, transformation, augmentation, and model training with performance evaluation.

## Dataset

- **Source:** `atp_matches_2024.csv`
- **Reference:** ATP data collected by Jeff Sackmann, available at [Tennis Abstract GitHub repo](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp?tab=readme-ov-file#atp-tennis-rankings-results-and-stats), used under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
- **Content:** Match-by-match performance statistics of players (e.g., aces, double faults, serve points).
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Matches with missing scores or early terminations (`RET`, `W/O`, `ABD`) are removed.
  - Statistical columns are converted to numeric types, coercing errors to NaN.

---

## Data Processing

- Winners are labeled as `p1`, losers as `p2` to create a consistent feature space.
- Data augmentation applied by **randomly swapping `p1` and `p2`** features to prevent bias.
- Binary classification target: `p1_win` (1 if p1 won, 0 otherwise).

---

## Model Details

- **Model:** `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn`
- **Scaling:** `StandardScaler` applied to features
- **Train-Test Split:** 70% training, 30% testing (stratified)
- **Evaluation:** `classification_report` (precision, recall, F1-score)
